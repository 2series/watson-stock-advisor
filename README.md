# Watson Stock Advisor

## Included Components

* [Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/discovery.html): A cognitive search and content analytics engine for applications to identify patterns, trends, and actionable insights.

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-stock-advisor` locally. In a terminal, run:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/ibm/watson-stock-advisor`


### 2. Create IBM Cloud services

Create the following services:

  * [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)
  * [**Cloudant NoSQL DB**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/)


### 3. Configure Watson Discovery

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. The first time you do this, you will see
"Before working with private data, we will need to set up your storage". Click 'Continue' and
wait for the storage to be set up.


Choose Watson Discover News

Under the `Overview` tab, `Collection Info` section, click `Use this collection in API` and copy the `Collection ID` and the `Environment ID` into your .env file as `DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID` and `DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`.


### 4. Provision NoSQL DB
    1. Navigate to console.bluemix.net
    2. Click 'Create Resource'
    3. Search for 'cloudant nosql'
    4. Select the only search result under 'Data & Analytics' called 'Cloudant NoSQL DB'
    5. Specify the settings you want
    6. Click 'Create' in the bottom right


### 5. Web Portal

The web page is adapted from a [template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/ "Start Boostrap SB Admin") from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/ "Start Bootstrap") by [Blackrock Digital](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital "Blackrock Digital").
You can find the repository for the template [here](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin "SB Admin Repo"), including its [License](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin/blob/master/LICENSE "SB Admin License").


### 6. Get IBM Cloud Services Credentials and add to .env file

As you create the Blumix Services, you'll need to create service credentials and get the
username and password:

Move the watson-stock-advisor/web/env.sample file to /.env and populate the service
credentials (and Cloudant URL) as you create the credentials:

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (Discovery), can be found in the ``Services`` menu in IBM Cloud,
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for each service.

The other settings for Discovery were collected during the
earlier setup steps (``ENV_ID``).

Navigate to the web directory and Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Replace the credentials here with your own.
# Rename this file to .env before starting the app.

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_USERNAME="XXXXXXXX"
DISCOVERY_PASSWORD="XXXXXXXXX"
DISCOVERY_VERSION="v1"
DISCOVERY_VERSION_DATE="2017-11-07"
DISCOVERY_ENV_ID="system"

# Cloudant
CLOUDANT_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"
CLOUDANT_PASSWORD="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
CLOUDANT_ACCESS="XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-bluemix.cloudant.com"
DB_NAME="XXXXXXXXXX"

# App Config
MAX_COMPANIES=20
MAX_ARTICLES_PER_COMPANY=100

```

### 7. Run the application

#### If you decided to run the app locally...

Navigate to /watson-stock-advisor/web directory, and run the following,

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm start
```
The portal should now be accessible on port 8080 (or another port specified by PORT in .env)
